1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:01,390
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,990
Just a quick update on the new Kalvin website.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:14,550
OK, so they have just changed the downloads section of this page and how they made it can be a little

4
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:15,300
bit confusing.

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:21,110
So I'm just making a quick update video to explain which exact version should you download.

6
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:28,380
So once you navigate to the calendar page, navigate to the download section and this is the new design,

7
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:34,260
they separated different versions into different categories on this page.

8
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:41,030
Now, since we talked about virtual machines, it might seem to you that we want to go to the virtual

9
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:46,610
machines and download a version from here, but not exactly for our course.

10
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,950
We want to go to the bare metal.

11
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:50,180
Click on that.

12
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:58,690
And here we want to download the version accordingly, we select 60 Forbert or 32 bit depending on our

13
00:00:58,690 --> 00:00:59,120
machine.

14
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:03,510
Since my machine is 64 bit, I would go with the 64 bit version.

15
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:09,370
If you're running an apple and one chip, then you want to select this one.

16
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:18,160
Since once again, I'm running sixty four bit, I want to go sixty four bit insular and it will download

17
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,890
the ISO image on my desktop.

18
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:21,870
Awesome.

19
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,740
That's all that they wanted to say.

20
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:25,720
And let's continue with the course.
