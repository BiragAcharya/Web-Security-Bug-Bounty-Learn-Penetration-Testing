1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:08,730
OK, just quick break, we have finished creating our environment and we are now ready to start getting

2
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:15,870
into all the website hacking and bug hunting, but there are a couple prerequisites that you might need

3
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:16,670
to do first.

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,250
In case you're a complete beginner and now is the best time to do them.

5
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:27,090
However, if you do feel confident knowing the basics of these things, feel free to continue with the

6
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:34,050
next section where we start a website and numeration and information gathering, and after that we dive

7
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,750
straight into website penetration testing and bug hunting.

8
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:45,540
However, as I mentioned, we need to be aware of bonus requirements first and lectures about them will

9
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:51,350
be inside the bonus sections, which are some very basic website development or website structure knowledge.

10
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,540
We must know what the email is, what JavaScript is, and other languages used in Web development.

11
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,330
We must know what they are for and how we can recognize them.

12
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,760
Besides that, we must also be familiar with Linux a little bit.

13
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:12,300
We must know the basic commands of Linux terminal and get familiarized with Linux structure itself.

14
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:20,900
And the last thing is that we must know networking a little bit as well, nothing to advance, but we

15
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:28,730
must know some basic things regarding IP addresses, local networks, DNS, HTP and so on and so on.

16
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:35,360
All three of these topics we have in the course added as bonus sections, the web development videos

17
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:42,050
and the links videos are in video format, while networking theory we offer in pedia format available

18
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:42,680
to download.

19
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:49,610
After you learn and get all three of them done and you feel comfortable with them, then we can proceed

20
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,130
to website penetration testing lectures.

21
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:59,540
OK, I just want to mention this and nonetheless we continue our journey in the next section where we

22
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:04,880
will learn how to enumerate websites and gather as much information about them as we can.
