1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:01,510
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:07,870
So in the previous video, we created our first virtual machine inside the bubble virtual box.

3
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:14,230
Now it is time that we install our clinics operating system inside of this machine.

4
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:22,030
But to be able to do that, we want to change some settings inside of this machine first before we actually

5
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:22,590
started.

6
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:29,620
So to access the settings of a virtual machine, we can select the virtual machine inside of our virtual

7
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:32,560
box manager and click on settings.

8
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:39,770
Now, to even be able to install the clinic's operating system, we must first add it to this machine,

9
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:40,160
right?

10
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:48,900
And to do that inside a virtual box, we must navigate to the storage settings and under the controller

11
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:49,800
idea.

12
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:52,390
We want to click on this ad icon.

13
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:59,170
And if you didn't see it really well, it just looks like a disk with a plus pretty much click on it

14
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,740
and you want to click on this ad button right here.

15
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:09,900
Once you do that, you want to navigate to wherever you have your ISO image saved or your Linux image

16
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,710
saved, for me it's on desktop and you want to double click it.

17
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:19,410
Then you want to select it right here in this small window and you want to click on CHOOSE.

18
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:26,400
Now, under the control idea, you will have your clinic's image and you will have this empty image.

19
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,670
Now, this empty image we don't really need.

20
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,420
So we can just.

21
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:29,840
Right.

22
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:36,020
Click it and remove attachment and we will be left with just called in two thousand twenty one point

23
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:36,830
one version.

24
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:43,550
OK, another thing that we want to do inside of the settings is we want to navigate to the network settings

25
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:48,900
and we want to change the net to Bridgid adapter.

26
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:55,340
Now, if you want to read more about these adapters inside the virtual box, you can check out our networking

27
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:58,040
PDF file that we created for this course.

28
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:03,430
And it has an explanation on all of these adapters right here and why we use this one.

29
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:12,110
In short words, we use the adapter because it allows our DCPI from our network to give an IP address

30
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:13,820
to our clinics virtual machine.

31
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:19,880
And in this case, our clinic's virtual machine will be viewed as another device on our network.

32
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:25,780
It will be able to communicate with all the other devices inside of our network, with our router,

33
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:29,580
with a laptop that you might have connected with your mobile device.

34
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:34,620
But if you have it under net, which is by default, it won't be able to do it.

35
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,180
So let's just change it to breach the adapter.

36
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:42,580
And under here, you want to select the adapter name or the adapter that you want to use.

37
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:49,510
Now, what I found from personal experience is that if you go with the cable connection, it most likely

38
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:55,570
will always work now via wireless adapters, not to create problems sometimes, and they might need

39
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:58,780
some additional TRIVERS installation in order to run.

40
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:06,100
So if you're able to try going with cable or wired connection, OK, these are the two settings that

41
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:06,910
we wanted to change.

42
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:13,630
Once we do that, we can click on OK, and right now we are ready to start our virtual machine.

43
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,500
To do that, we want to click on this start erro.

44
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:26,030
And it will run our virtual machine or it will start the installation process of Linux.

45
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:29,560
Remember, it's an operating system, so it must be installed first.

46
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:36,200
Here is the window of our rental machine, and you will notice if you try to enlarge it, it will pretty

47
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,410
much stay the same size.

48
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,500
It will have this white surrounding it.

49
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,860
But don't worry, it will not stay like this forever.

50
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:44,730
It will only stay like this during the installation.

51
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:50,800
So what we want to do is we want to choose the graphical install right here in this menu.

52
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:54,020
You can also go with install about the graphical install.

53
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:55,470
Looks a little bit better.

54
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:56,620
Let's click here.

55
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:57,080
Enter.

56
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:05,490
And by the way, your mouth will not work inside of the virtual machine yet during the installation.

57
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:09,500
So you must navigate with your keyboard inside of the installation process.

58
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,260
Let's wait for the next step.

59
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:20,060
And here it is, we want to select the language to be English for me, you can choose whichever language

60
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,760
you want the location.

61
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:23,780
It doesn't really matter.

62
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:28,030
I will just select United States and the configuration of the keyboard.

63
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,250
You can also choose whatever you like right here.

64
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:34,370
I'm going to go with American English and click on Next.

65
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:39,340
And this installation process will actually take about an hour to finish.

66
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,070
So, of course, this is not going to be an hour long video.

67
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,290
So I'm just going to skip through some longer parts of installation and I'm just going to cover the

68
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,660
steps where we actually have to choose something.

69
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:55,030
I will fast forward the installation so you don't have to sit through a one hour video.

70
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:57,850
OK, so let's wait for the next step.

71
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:04,950
And here is the next thing that comes up, which is configuring the network, so it asks us, please

72
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:08,770
enter the hostname for the system, you can type here.

73
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,230
Also anything that you want.

74
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:16,320
I'm just going to type here, Kelly, because we're installing Linux press enter and the next thing

75
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,200
that it asks is the domain name here.

76
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,170
For the purposes of the course, we don't need to set anything.

77
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:26,460
We can just leave it empty and we can press enter to continue.

78
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:34,840
Now, a user account must be created, so here you create the full name for the user for the purposes

79
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,500
of discourse.

80
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:37,780
I'm just going to call it Mr. Hacker.

81
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:43,750
Click on continue and username for the account that you will use to login to clinics.

82
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,420
The account name will also be Mr. Hacker.

83
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,710
For me, for you.

84
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,220
Choose anything that you like.

85
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,770
Just make sure that you remember it after the installation and press enter.

86
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:57,970
And now we need to set the password for the user here.

87
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:00,160
You type the password, whatever you like.

88
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:09,140
And here you confirm the password, once you do that, you also have an option to show password in clear.

89
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,610
I don't really need that.

90
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,500
So I'm just going to go on continue.

91
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:17,480
And you can see sometimes mouse actually works, but sometimes it doesn't.

92
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:23,990
So I'm just going to go and navigate again with my keyboard and select the time zone that I'm at.

93
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:28,250
Since I'm at Eastern Time Zone, I'm going to select Eastern.

94
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:33,040
You select whichever you want and it will continue with the installation.

95
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:35,090
Let's wait for the next step.

96
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:41,460
And here it is, partitioning this now, this might be a little bit harder for you to understand in

97
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,980
case your first time running Linux.

98
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:48,440
Nonetheless, here we want to go with the guided use entire disk.

99
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:50,720
We don't want to go any other option.

100
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:53,960
And here we want to select our own hard disk that we created.

101
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:56,790
So you will probably have only one option here.

102
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,520
Just select that one and click enter.

103
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:07,010
And this part, we want to go with all files in one partition, as it says it's recommended for new

104
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:13,040
users, for those of you that friendliness before you might also be familiar with slash home, slash

105
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,270
VA slash top.

106
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:19,400
And these are just some directories that we get inside of Linux.

107
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:25,270
Picture them as just some already made folders the clinic system gives us after the installation.

108
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,560
We don't want to separate any of these.

109
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:29,930
Let's pretend that we don't know anything about this.

110
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:35,240
So we're just going to go with the recommended settings that says all files in one partition and click

111
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,080
enter.

112
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:43,590
It will ask, has finished petitioning and write changes to this, we want to click, enter, and here

113
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:46,530
it asks us for the confirmation where we want to click.

114
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:48,350
Yes, so change from now.

115
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:48,840
Yes.

116
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,560
And click.

117
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,400
Enter.

118
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:57,080
And this will pretty much start the installation process of your clinics now, there will be a couple

119
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,880
of more questions during the installation.

120
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:02,450
So I'm just going to fast forward to the next question.

121
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,770
OK, so after a couple of minutes, we get this window prompted.

122
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:12,570
So it asks us to customize our own desktop with different settings.

123
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:17,840
So here, what we want to do is we want to select all of these that are checked by default, which is

124
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,520
desktop environment, X, F.C. and collection of tools.

125
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:27,920
However, we also want to check this large option right here.

126
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:33,080
This means that it will also install some additional tools inside of our Callinan's machine.

127
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,910
And the more tools, the better.

128
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:38,090
We never know when we are going to use some of these tools.

129
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,740
So let's just go and select large and we can proceed with the installation.

130
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,960
This next part will take some time to finish.

131
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,260
It will take around 30 to 40 minutes to finish.

132
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:54,930
So just sit back, grab something to drink, and I will see you guys when the next question pops up.

133
00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:02,920
OK, so here's the next question, and this isn't really that important to us, it would be more important

134
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:07,800
if we were to install Linux as a main operating system and not as a virtual machine.

135
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,090
But let's read it nonetheless.

136
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:15,820
As it says, it seems that this is the new installation is the only operating system on this computer.

137
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:23,680
If so, it should be safe to install the bootloader to your primary drive warning if your computer has

138
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,620
another operating system that the installer failed to detect.

139
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:32,980
This will make that operating system temporarily unsuitable, though Grupp can be manually configured

140
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:33,340
later.

141
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:36,270
To put it now here we want to select.

142
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:42,340
Yes, because our virtual machine doesn't have any other operating system running besides Carol Linux.

143
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,560
So let's select.

144
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,260
Yes, right here and let's click on CONTINUE.

145
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:57,380
Under here, we want to select this as the age and we want to continue and this will pretty much finish

146
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:03,050
our installation, it will take a couple more minutes for this to end, and then we will have a working

147
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:04,790
clinic's virtual machine.

148
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,780
And here is the last question.

149
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:13,590
It says installation is complete, so it is time to put into your new system, make sure to remove any

150
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:18,960
installation media so that you put into the new system rather than restarting the installation.

151
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:25,020
Since we don't have any installation media, we can just click on continue without unplugging anything

152
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,220
or removing anything.

153
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:30,050
And our installation is complete now.

154
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:35,320
Our virtual machine will reboot and we will be able to use our Linux virtual machine.

155
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:39,540
Let's wait for a couple of seconds for our login screen to pop out.

156
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:46,570
And here is our login screen, our Caledonius machine is working perfectly us.

157
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:52,920
Now here we want to type in the username that we created during the installation, as well as the password

158
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,690
that was set during the installation.

159
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:58,530
So I'm just going to go with Mr. Hacker because that is what they set.

160
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,980
And I will type here the password for Mr. Hacker account.

161
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,390
This will open our desktop environment.

162
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:14,220
In case you're also stuck like this with a smaller screen, in order to make your machine full screen,

163
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:19,490
you can just lower the screen and enlarge it once again.

164
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,040
And this will actually fix the issue in 90 percent of cases.

165
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:26,700
And now we can see the clinic's desktop environment.

166
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:33,110
As I mentioned, and as we already know by now, this is a Linux system, so if you're not familiar

167
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:39,590
with the limbic system and Linux terminal command lines and commands that we will use, make sure you

168
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:44,570
check out the bonus section of the course where we actually cover Linux basics, where we teach the

169
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:50,900
basic commands, where we teach how we can use Linux terminal in order to execute what we want.

170
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:57,530
Nonetheless, if you are familiar with Linux and with Linux terminal, feel free to proceed with the

171
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:57,980
course.

172
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:04,370
We made our virtual hacking machine and the next thing that we want to do is we want to create a virtual

173
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:06,480
machine that we will use to attack.

174
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:07,890
OK, awesome.

175
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:12,950
We finished a big part of setting up our virtual lab and I will see you guys in the next video.
