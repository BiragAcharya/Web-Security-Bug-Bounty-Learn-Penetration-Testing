1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:10,130
OK, let's think for setting up our environment is creating the tri hack me account, as I already mentioned

2
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:16,700
on this website, we have a couple of free practice examples that we can use to elevate our skills and

3
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,600
to learn even more about website vulnerabilities.

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,920
But for the start, we only want to create an account and later on we will use it throughout the course.

5
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:27,970
For now, let's just create it.

6
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,750
So this would be a rather short video.

7
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:34,170
All they want to do is you want to navigate to try hack me dot com.

8
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:40,280
It will open up this page where you want to go on joining now, since you don't have an account, you

9
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,230
want to set it up right here.

10
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:49,380
So it requires an username, email, password, experience level, and to select that, you're not a

11
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:50,400
robot, hopefully.

12
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:57,340
Now, make sure that you use a valid email, because it will ask you for verification after creating

13
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:02,170
an account, once you do that, you can log into your account, and I will do that right now.

14
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:09,570
And once you log in, you should have something like this now, after you verify your email, you can

15
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:16,470
go and browse to learn to compete and you can check out all of the modules that this website has so

16
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,860
we can go under the modules which we went to by going online.

17
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:25,620
And we have some Linux fundamentals, networking fundamentals, Web hacking fundamentals, which is

18
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,260
the module that we are interested in for this course.

19
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,850
But you also have some other modules that might interest you after four.

20
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,430
Now we're mostly focused on Web hacking.

21
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:40,560
So you want to go to that module and here we have a couple of free exercises.

22
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,420
Now, these are the exercises that we are going to touch inside of the course.

23
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,600
This is what the platform offers us for free.

24
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:50,550
And we're only going to use what the platform offers us for free.

25
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:55,010
And later on, if you decide that you like this platform, you can upgrade to premium.

26
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:59,610
But for this course, it will not be needed under the dashboard.

27
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:05,190
You have some other things, such as how many users there are, what rank you have, and rank is simply

28
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:07,470
just based on how many points you get by.

29
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:13,590
Solving different challenges in different rooms and room is something that other people create to make

30
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,650
practice examples on a hosted vulnerable machines.

31
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,230
Once you solve them, you get points.

32
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,660
Once you get points, you become a higher rank.

33
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,780
So this is just the basic things about the platform.

34
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:30,870
For now, it's just important that you have an account and later on we're going to join a room and start

35
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,900
exploring different vulnerabilities at different rooms.

36
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,720
Offer us if you created everything successfully.

37
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:43,530
We are fully done with setting up our environment and in the next section we can start off with website

38
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,980
and numeration and information gathering.

39
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:47,310
So there.
