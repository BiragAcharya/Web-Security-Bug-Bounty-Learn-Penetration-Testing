1
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:04,640
All right, time to set up our virtual environment.

2
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:11,920
Now, there are a lot of things that we must do first, as we said, we must create a virtual machine

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,580
that we are going to use for that.

4
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:20,500
We need the virtualization software and the operating system that we want to install.

5
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:25,630
The operating system that we're going to use will be clinics, as we previously mentioned.

6
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:32,590
And also besides that, we will also need our virtual machine that will host vulnerable Web pages that

7
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:33,310
we can attack.

8
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:39,560
And another way that we're going to practice will be through a website called Tri Hack Me.

9
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,370
Now, this website does offer a paid subscription, but we're going to cover things that the website

10
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:49,100
offers for free just so we can include everyone inside of it.

11
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:55,900
It has really good practice examples of website vulnerabilities with the combination of vulnerable virtual

12
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,580
machine and with practice.

13
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:03,070
Examples on this website will cover most known and most common website vulnerabilities.

14
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:09,580
OK, let's first start off by downloading Virtual Box, which is the virtualization software that we

15
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,390
use, and let's also download our clinic's operating system.

16
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,990
Let's start with virtual box first to download Virtual Box.

17
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,770
We want to navigate to the page virtual box dot org.

18
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:28,760
It will lead you to this official page of the website, and if you want, you can read through all of

19
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,870
these articles and about four toybox if you'd like.

20
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:35,360
But right now, we're going to see how we can download and install it.

21
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:38,270
As it says, it has a big download button.

22
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:44,900
Just click on it and it will lead us to this page, which will offer us different platform packages

23
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,960
based on which operating system you're running.

24
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:52,250
As we can see, the current version is six point one point eighteen.

25
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:58,760
And the current platform packages that they have are for Windows hosts or OSX hosts, Linux distributions

26
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,410
and Solaris hosts.

27
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:05,020
Depending on your operating system, you want to choose which one you want to install.

28
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:10,100
Since I'm running windows on this machine, I will click on Windows Host.

29
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:16,660
It will ask me what it wants to download a virtual box just like desktop and click save.

30
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:20,810
And as you can see, it will start downloading it right here.

31
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:25,460
Since I already have it, I will just cancel this download, already have it installed.

32
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,350
So I'm not going to do that right now.

33
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:34,480
And while it's downloading for you, let's navigate to the clinic's official website, which is Etling

34
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:39,860
Kelly dot org, and let's see how we can download Cal Linux operating system.

35
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:47,130
OK, so we open up this page, it is the most advanced penetration testing distribution.

36
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:51,380
And as with Purtle Box, it has this download button.

37
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,940
Let's click on it.

38
00:02:54,140 --> 00:03:01,100
And it will lead us to the official download page now this download page offers the newest release of

39
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:08,630
Linux or should I say the newest official release, because you also have the weekly unstable and untested

40
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:09,220
releases.

41
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,340
We're interested in the official stable release.

42
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,980
Currently, it is the clinic's two thousand twenty one point one and the new version of clinics actually

43
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,030
comes out pretty much every two months.

44
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:27,620
So if you encounter a new version of Linux or a newer version of your toolbox, feel free to download

45
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:31,610
that one instead, since right now the newest one is two thousand twenty one point one.

46
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,900
I will download this.

47
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:37,130
Now, we have quite a few options right here that we can choose from.

48
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:46,900
We have the 64 bit in-store clinics, 64 bit live and clinics, 64 bit net insular as well.

49
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:51,850
We have four Apple and one we have clinics are 60 for installer.

50
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,730
We have the live and the net installer.

51
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:57,020
And we also have four 32 bit systems.

52
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:01,390
Now, if you're running Apple and one, you can go with this one.

53
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:07,140
If you're running a 64 bit machine, you can go with Kalanak, 64 bit insular.

54
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,920
And if you're in any case, which I doubt anyone will be running at 32 bit machine.

55
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:16,720
But if you do, you can download clinics, 32 bit insular.

56
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:24,010
Now, since I'm running a 64 bit Windows machine, I will go with Kalinich 64 bit insular if I click

57
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:24,400
on this.

58
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:28,700
It will once again ask me where I want to download it.

59
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:31,820
I will select desktop and I will click save.

60
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:35,530
You will notice that the size of this file is pretty large.

61
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,340
It's four gigabytes, so it will take some time.

62
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:43,040
Now, luckily, I already have it, so I'm just going to cancel this download.

63
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:47,090
You just wait for both of your downloads to finish and then we can proceed.

64
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:52,030
Oh, and by the way, you also have an option to download it over Torrent if you'd like.

65
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:53,560
It's completely up to you.

66
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,850
OK, awesome.

67
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:01,620
Now, let's say that you have both of your files ready if you don't just post this video until your

68
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:06,690
downloads are finished and you should have these two files on your desktop.

69
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:10,810
Let's go with installing a virtual box first.

70
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,360
So to do that, we can double click the installer file.

71
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:24,650
It will open the welcome window we want to just go next to we want to go next here as well and here

72
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:28,930
you can check some option if you don't like, we'll just create the shortcut on the desktop.

73
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:32,000
And I will leave everything checked and click on next.

74
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:39,290
And here we have a warning that says installing the Oracle virtual box networking feature will reset

75
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:43,220
your network connection and temporarily disconnect you from the network.

76
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,640
Proceed with the installation now.

77
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:49,280
So this pretty much says, in case you're doing something important over the Internet, make sure you

78
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,070
finish with that first before installing virtual box.

79
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:56,640
Otherwise, you might have some Internet connection problems during the installation.

80
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:01,490
I will just select here, proceed and I will click install.

81
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,960
OK, so here it asks for administrator password.

82
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,990
Since I don't have one, I will just click here.

83
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,450
Yes.

84
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,810
And it will install a virtual box for me.

85
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,620
This doesn't take much time.

86
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:20,150
It takes maybe a minute or two depending on your system and once it finishes it should open up your

87
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,320
virtual box.

88
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,730
And here is the finished window.

89
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:27,830
We want to check StarTalk for Tool Box and click on Finish.

90
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:33,050
Let's wait a couple of seconds, and here it is.

91
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,560
This is the window of Oracle for Tool Box.

92
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,850
Now, let's do one more thing before we end this video.

93
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:44,090
Let's see how we can create a virtual machine inside the virtual box.

94
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,780
So this is the official window that we have.

95
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,700
We have a couple of buttons right here.

96
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:52,600
And here will be our machines that we currently don't have.

97
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,130
So let's create one.

98
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,880
Let's create our colonics virtual machine.

99
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:04,780
To do that, we want to click on this button that says you click on it and it will ask us for a couple

100
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:07,590
of information, name of the virtual machine.

101
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,140
And here, let's say that we type Kaldi two thousand twenty one.

102
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:19,140
Here you can select the path where the machine folder will be stored, here we select the type of operating

103
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:24,570
system and since Cal Linux is a Linux operating system, we will select right here, Linux.

104
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:31,020
And the version now this can be a little bit tricky if you don't know, but luckily I'm here to tell

105
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:38,850
you that Carol Lin is based on Debian, so we want to select here Debian 64 bit, or in case you have

106
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:42,810
a 32 bit machine, you want to select Debian 32 a bit.

107
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:50,760
Since we downloaded the clinic 64 bit and we have a 64 bit machine, we want to proceed with the version

108
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,920
of Debian 64 bit.

109
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:53,430
Let's click on Next.

110
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:59,690
The next thing that it asks us is what ram memory we want to give to this virtual machine.

111
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:02,010
This is completely up to you.

112
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:09,060
I'm just here to advise you that you should not go below one gigabyte ram and two gigabyte of RAM is

113
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,270
pretty much all you need.

114
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,850
You don't need more than this.

115
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:19,080
If you have like four gigabyte ram or less, feel free to proceed by setting only one gigabyte.

116
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:25,920
But since I have more than four gigabytes of RAM on my house machine, I can set here at least two gigabytes.

117
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:31,800
If you have like thirty two gigabytes of RAM on your machine, you can even increase this up to four

118
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:36,590
or eight gigabytes of RAM depending on how fast you want your machine to work.

119
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:42,690
Now I'm completely fine with two, so I'm just going to select two thousand forty eight megabytes and

120
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:46,140
I'm going to click on Next under the hard disk.

121
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:49,020
It asks us for a couple of options.

122
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:53,520
We just want to stick with the one that's already checked, which is create a virtual hard disk now

123
00:08:53,730 --> 00:09:01,710
and we want to click on create the hard disk file type will be VDI or virtual box disk image.

124
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:02,910
Click on next.

125
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:06,860
And storage on a physical hard disk.

126
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,000
This is completely up to you.

127
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:14,570
I'm just going to go with the NEMATI allocated and you have the explanation of both of these right here.

128
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:21,350
As it says, a dynamically allocated hard disk file will only use based on your physical hard disk as

129
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:27,230
it fills up up to the maximum fixed site, although it will not shrink again automatically.

130
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:34,730
One space on it is frit and a fixed size hard disk file may take longer to create that subsystems,

131
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,340
but it is often faster to use.

132
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:43,330
So a fixed size is indeed sometimes faster to use, but nonetheless, I'm just going to go with dynamically

133
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:46,010
allocated and I'm going to click on next.

134
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:53,360
And the last option, I believe, is how much this size we want to give to our virtual machine.

135
00:09:54,080 --> 00:10:01,210
Now, I advise you not to go below 25 to 30 gigabytes of hard disk space.

136
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,580
I'm just going to select here like thirty eight.

137
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:05,650
It doesn't really matter.

138
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:11,260
You can give it more or less if you'd like, but don't go below twenty to twenty five gigabytes.

139
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:14,480
Otherwise your machine might not work.

140
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:23,600
OK, now that we selected all of this we can click on create and as you can see we created our first

141
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,950
virtual machine.

142
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:30,200
We have it right here as well as we have it's information on the right.

143
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:36,410
We have its general information system, information display settings, storage settings and a bunch

144
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:39,440
of other things that we are going to take a look at in the next video.

145
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:42,280
This doesn't mean that our machine will work.

146
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:47,590
We still have an operating system to install before being able to use this machine.

147
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,050
For now, we only created it inside a virtual box.

148
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:58,070
In the next video, we're going to add our Linux operating system or ISO image that we downloaded from

149
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:59,030
the official website.

150
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:02,810
And we are going to install it inside of this virtual machine.

151
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:08,240
And hopefully by the end of next video, we will have a working clinics virtual machine.
