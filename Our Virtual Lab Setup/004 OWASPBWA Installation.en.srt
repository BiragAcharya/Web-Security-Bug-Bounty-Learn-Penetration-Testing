1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,030
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:09,240
It's time to install the machine that we will use to attack for this course, I have chosen the OS Broken

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,800
Web Applications Project.

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:12,510
Why this machine?

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,690
Well, first of all, it's very simple to install.

6
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:18,450
It takes quite a little time compared to Kalanick.

7
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:21,150
It will only take us a minute or two to install it.

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:28,980
And it also has a bunch of vulnerable Web applications hosted on this machine that we can use to target

9
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:29,930
and attack.

10
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:36,800
Now, to download it, we can navigate to the link of SourceForge dot net slash projects.

11
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,880
Slash or wasp b.

12
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,660
W a.

13
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:45,770
Under this link, we will have the download button and then just by clicking on it, we can start the

14
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:52,700
downloading process, which will ask us where we want to save the Wesp Broken Web application virtual

15
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:53,100
machine.

16
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:58,430
Now, since I already have it downloaded, I'm not going to do that, but I just saved it right here

17
00:00:58,430 --> 00:00:59,320
on my desktop.

18
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:05,780
And as you may notice, once you start downloading it, it will take a couple of minutes because the

19
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:08,300
file size is around two gigabytes large.

20
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:14,010
But once you finish with the downloading, you will have this zip file right here.

21
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:19,700
So in order to get our files that we need, we must extract this zip file first.

22
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:27,250
After we extracted, you will get a folder like this and inside of that folder you will have these files.

23
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:31,710
Now, these are the files that we need in order to create a virtual machine.

24
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,340
So let's get straight to creating it.

25
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,040
OK, open up your virtual box.

26
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,670
And we're already familiar as to how we can start the process of creating a virtual machine, navigate

27
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,450
to tools and click on.

28
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:48,890
Now we get this window that we got for our clinics as well.

29
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:55,310
And here we're just going to call it a WASP B W A now, of course, you can call it whatever you like.

30
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,050
I'm just going to leave it with this name.

31
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:02,570
And since this is also a Linux machine under type, we want to select Linux.

32
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:10,150
A version of Linux, however, should be all the way down to other Linux 64 or other Linux 32 bit.

33
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:14,480
Let me select other Linux 64 bit and I will proceed the next.

34
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:20,770
Under the memory size, you can live with anything between five hundred and twelve megabytes, up to

35
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:24,530
one gigabyte, it really doesn't need any more ram memory.

36
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:30,040
I'm just going to leave it on one gigabyte of RAM and I'm going to proceed with the next step.

37
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:36,650
This is the part that differs from colonics installation, instead of going with creative Ertl hard

38
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:36,900
disk.

39
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:41,690
Now we want to select use an existing virtual hard disk.

40
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:46,160
And under that, we want to go to this icon right here.

41
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,170
And we want to click on at.

42
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:57,170
Once we do that, we want to navigate to where our folder is with extracted files from our zip file

43
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:01,970
that we downloaded, double click there and you will have all of these options.

44
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:09,080
Now, the file that we want to choose right here is going to be over broken web apps, S.L one without

45
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,360
any extension, as these ones have.

46
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:16,790
So we want to select this one and you will notice that its size is also the smallest.

47
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:18,380
Let's select it.

48
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:22,640
Let's double click it again and let's click on Create.

49
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:28,660
Before starting this machine, I just want to mention a few things if we go to settings.

50
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:37,460
And we go to network settings, we also want to change from that to breeched adapter, the same thing

51
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,710
that we did with our Kleenex machine.

52
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:45,560
But with this machine, we need to be a little bit cautious because this is a vulnerable machine.

53
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,490
It hosts a Web page with a bunch of vulnerabilities.

54
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:54,620
So only use Bridgit adapter if you're running this machine in a safe home network.

55
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:59,240
If you're running it in your own network, then feel free to use Brutsch adapter.

56
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:06,920
Don't use bridge adapter in a company network or in a public network or anywhere else that there might

57
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,120
be untrusted devices, even though it's a virtual machine.

58
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:14,300
But nonetheless, it's always good to have maximum security as possible.

59
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:20,640
So select the chapter on their names, select the adapter that you want and click on, OK?

60
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:27,370
And that's pretty much it all we have to do right now is start the machine and it will start the process

61
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,700
of installing all the things that it needs.

62
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:33,620
And that pretty much takes a couple of minutes, not too long.

63
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:35,830
So let's just wait for that.

64
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:43,250
And here it is, after two or three minutes, the machine is ready to use.

65
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,950
Now, you might notice that it doesn't have any display whatsoever.

66
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:53,710
Instead, we get this command line interface that we can use and it's made like this.

67
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:59,530
So that machine could take as little space as possible and it can be made as fast as possible.

68
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:05,830
Of course, in order for us to actually be able to access this command line, we need to log in first.

69
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:13,410
And it tells us down here that we can log in with username and password or WASP B.W..

70
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:15,760
So let's type that in

71
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:25,180
and it will give us something like a terminal and we can use the terminal to run the commands.

72
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:30,160
The same commands that we can't run in a regular Linux terminal such as Alice, Who Am I?

73
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,480
And a bunch of other commands.

74
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,280
We can also ping other devices.

75
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:40,930
And it also gives us our IP address right here, which in my case is 192, that 168, that one that

76
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:41,230
for.

77
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:44,660
And this is another reason that we set it to bridge that chapter.

78
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:50,460
It gave me an IP address that I can visit from any network device that they have connected to my network.

79
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:57,070
So I'm just going to go for my host machine and type in one eye to that 168, that one that for now,

80
00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:00,610
in your case, this will probably be a different IP address.

81
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:04,480
So you can either check it right here or you can also type the command.

82
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:10,740
I have config, which will also give you an IP address of all of us, BWI.

83
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:16,750
So let me navigate to the IP address of this virtual machine inside of my House Machine's browser.

84
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,650
And this is the page that it should open up.

85
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:30,040
Here we have many things from training applications to realistic, intentionally vulnerable applications.

86
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:36,460
We also have some old vulnerable versions of real applications and we have applications for testing

87
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,370
tools as well.

88
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,150
Some other things as well.

89
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,550
Now, there are a lot of things here we're not going to cover all of them, but we're going to cover

90
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:52,440
some that are aimed at discovering the most common website vulnerabilities now that we got it set up.

91
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:59,310
Let's also make sure that we can communicate with this over SPW, a machine from our calumnies machine.

92
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:00,880
So start both of them.

93
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:03,150
We already have our own USB started.

94
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:07,110
Let's start our Linux machine and wait for it to boot up.

95
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:17,530
So here is our login screen, let's log in and to be able to check whether we can communicate with our

96
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:22,590
wesp machine, what we can do is we can simply just open our terminal.

97
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:27,990
And by the way, once again, if you're not familiar with terminal, make sure that you check out the

98
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,600
section on Linux basics there.

99
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,940
We teach the basic commands of Linux terminals.

100
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:40,530
You can get familiar with it and it hopefully will become your second major in the next open terminal.

101
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,670
We use this icon.

102
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:46,470
It will open up this command line where we can type our commands.

103
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:51,750
And in our case, we want to pick one to that 168 at one point four.

104
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:53,880
And once again, this is in my case.

105
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,910
In your case, it might be a different IP address.

106
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,710
So I'm just going to press enter.

107
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:05,300
And if you get an output like this, that means that we successfully pinged this machine.

108
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,710
So the connection part is good.

109
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:12,620
They can communicate between each other and in order to close off this command, you can type control,

110
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:16,160
see simply and it'll finish with being OK.

111
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:21,540
Also, now that we set this up, the next thing and the last thing that we want to do in setting up

112
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:26,300
our environment is we want to just create an account on Try Hack Me website.

113
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,760
So that will be a rather short video.

114
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:34,050
We've finished most of our work and let's create the tri hacking account in the next video.

115
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:35,120
See you there.
