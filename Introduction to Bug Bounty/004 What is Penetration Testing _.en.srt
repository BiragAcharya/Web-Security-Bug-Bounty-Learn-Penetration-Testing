00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:02,570
Hello and welcome to the course.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:10,670
Now, the best way that we can start this is by explaining what even is penetration testing.

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,800
Most of you will know this, but let's still cover it as a refresher, at least.

4
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:23,360
So whether we're talking about network penetration testing or website penetration testing or something

5
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:29,840
as simple as a single device penetration testing, all of this has the same part inside of their name

6
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:32,100
penetration testing.

7
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:33,860
So what is it?

8
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:42,740
Well, we can refer to it as an action that we apply to enumerate and discover new vulnerabilities,

9
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:47,290
as well as exploit them and take control of our target system.

10
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:54,680
Now, most of you might or might not know, but penetration testing is constructed of couple of stages.

11
00:00:55,370 --> 00:01:01,910
Let's say we have our hacking machine on the left and the target device that we are trying to gain access

12
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:03,290
to is on the right.

13
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:09,530
This device can be anything from a PC to a mobile phone to a website application.

14
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,130
It doesn't really matter.

15
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:17,760
The process of penetration testing goes the same way we start off with gathering information.

16
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,900
We want to know as much about our target as possible.

17
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:30,620
Why, what this allows us to better plan out our attack later on, gathering information can be done

18
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:32,780
both actively and passively.

19
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:40,320
Active information gathering is gathering information by interacting with the target, while passive

20
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:47,370
information gathering means that we get all of our information without ever interacting with the target

21
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,360
in any way.

22
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:55,950
For example, we can get information about Facebook by Googling it and reading about it on another site,

23
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:00,690
like Wikipedia that is considered passive information gathering.

24
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:09,490
After this comes scanning, now, scanning is a deeper form of information gathering, and it's done

25
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:16,940
actively, which means we directly interact with the target in order to find out more information about

26
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:17,100
it.

27
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:24,750
Usually this will be the information of technical nature, like what technologies does the target run,

28
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:31,180
what is their website made of if they have one, which post they have open and so on and so on?

29
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:37,130
We finished scanning by performing vulnerability analysis winnability.

30
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:44,090
Now, this is just us finding security holes in the target system with the help of information that

31
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:44,630
we gathered.

32
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:51,690
After that, we can successfully exploit the target by using different methods and attacks.

33
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:55,620
These are the main steps to penetration testing.

34
00:02:56,210 --> 00:03:01,160
There are other steps, of course, that come after, like maintaining access on the target machine

35
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,690
and covering tracks.

36
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:09,440
But these steps that we mentioned are crucial now that we covered and went through the basic steps of

37
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,100
penetration testing and what those steps are.

38
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:17,750
We can also say that penetration testing can be divided into two main groups.

39
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:25,280
We got network penetration testing, which could, for example, be let's say a company gives you their

40
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:31,430
IP ranges of their networks and we're supposed to perform a penetration test on all of their devices

41
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:34,520
to see if there are any security issues.

42
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:42,710
Those devices could be anything from computers, mobile phones to printers, and for the second group,

43
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:46,900
we can say that its website application penetration testing.

44
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:53,650
Here we perform various different tacks to determine whether the website that we are attacking is properly

45
00:03:53,650 --> 00:04:01,660
coded and secured, and website penetration testing is something that will put the most focus on inside

46
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,290
of this course.

47
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:09,260
This is because this field is becoming bigger and bigger every single day due to millions and millions

48
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:14,690
of websites that are online and available right now on the Internet, the search for people to secure

49
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:17,320
and protect them is rising every day.

50
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:21,590
You might have also heard of a term called bug bounty.

51
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:24,250
This is pretty much the same thing.

52
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:31,560
It's mostly referring to discovering bugs or also known as vulnerabilities inside the Web page and backboned

53
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,590
is something that we'll discuss a little bit more in the next video.

54
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:41,910
But before we get to it, let's mention what are the two main things we need to perform, bug bounty

55
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,040
or website penetration testing.

56
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:49,810
So we will need a virtual machine and a wonderful Web page.

57
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:56,070
Now we will install a virtual machine to create our own hacking lab or environment that we will use

58
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:58,250
to perform all of our attacks.

59
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:04,320
But as you may notice, to be able to perform a penetration test on the website, we will need a website.

60
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:04,900
Right.

61
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:11,220
Luckily, there are many vulnerable Web pages that we can run within our local network on the virtual

62
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:16,650
machine that are useful for practicing different attacks and discovering different bugs.

63
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:23,340
And that is also why we need to cover virtual machines now, don't worry, we will cover installing

64
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:28,440
all of these from installing our own machine that we will use to hack to installing machines with a

65
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,770
vulnerable webpage.

66
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,380
And trust me, it's not that hard as it might sound like.

67
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:40,200
Nonetheless, now that we mention some basics of penetration testing, let's discuss bug bounty in the

68
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,180
next video, SIDOR.
