1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:07,530
Hello, welcome to the Web security and bug bounty course now you've already seen the promo video and

2
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:12,990
you kind of know what this course is about, but in this video, we want to do a full course outline

3
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:18,720
so that you know exactly what we're going to learn, so that you have a clear path to success and what

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,400
this course is going to give you.

5
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:27,510
Now, one thing to keep in mind is that this course isn't just for ethical hackers or penetration testers.

6
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:33,250
We've made this course so that anybody that's interested in Web security can learn from it.

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,480
So if you are a web developer that wants to improve their web security, well, this course is for you

8
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:39,840
as well.

9
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:46,170
And obviously, if you want to become a bug bounty hunter or a penetration tester, well, this course

10
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,580
is definitely for you as well.

11
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:48,210
All right.

12
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:53,450
Let's get into actually what the course is going to look like for you right off the bat.

13
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,310
We're going to start off by creating what we call our virtual.

14
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,980
This is a hacking lab to make sure that we keep our computers safe throughout the course and we can

15
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,390
do different sorts of attacks and experiments on them.

16
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:11,660
And this course is going to work with any type of system that you have, Linux, Windows, Mac OS,

17
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,180
everything's going to work because we're going to set up this virtual lab for you.

18
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:19,870
From there, we're going to learn about enumeration and information gathered.

19
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:24,240
This is where we actually start with the bug bounty and website penetration testing.

20
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:29,610
We cover numerous topics and tools that allow us to gather as much information about a certain Web site

21
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,380
as possible.

22
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,800
From there, we get into introducing you to burps.

23
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,200
And this is a very important tool of a bug hunter.

24
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:41,700
And it will set us up for a lot of the topics that we cover later in the course.

25
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,670
We then get into our first but and this first bug on our website, we're going to talk about a Schimel

26
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:48,170
injection.

27
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:52,090
It's one of the easier bugs to find and use.

28
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,700
So this is where we start.

29
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,150
But then we get into more complex topics.

30
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:00,440
For example, we're going to talk about command injections and execution.

31
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:07,200
This is an extremely dangerous bug where we can inject commands through an input and affect a server

32
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:07,920
or a system.

33
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,100
We then talk about broken authentication.

34
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:14,860
What happens when authentication on a Web site is not done properly?

35
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,180
Well, we can take advantage of it and we're going to show you how to do that.

36
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:24,330
And we're going to use different examples to things like cookie values, HTP requests, forgot password

37
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:25,460
page and a lot more.

38
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,460
We then get into brute force attacks even if a website is secure.

39
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:36,420
If we as testers have an easy and simple password set, then it's also going to be easy for us to guess

40
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,520
it using what we call brute force attacks.

41
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,800
And we're going to show you how to prevent brute force attacks as well as show you how they work.

42
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:46,530
We then talk about broken access control.

43
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:53,820
Access control enforces policy such as what user can and cannot do or intended permissions for a user.

44
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:58,200
When that access control is broken, well, we can take advantage of it.

45
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,310
Then we dive into what we call cross site scripting.

46
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:08,400
This is a very common attack and we're going to talk about all three main types of cross site scripting

47
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:12,360
which are stored, reflected and DOM based cross site scripting.

48
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:19,230
Then we dive into one of the most common ways that you can effect a system and probably one of the bigger

49
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:23,430
vulnerabilities that always comes up, and that is escarole injection.

50
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:28,510
This is where we're able to access or manipulate the database.

51
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,080
This is probably one of the most important section.

52
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:36,020
And again, we're going to talk about how we can use it and also how to prevent it.

53
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,560
I know we have a lot.

54
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,750
There's still a few more in this section.

55
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:47,040
We're going to talk about XML data and how we can use Xixi or XML external entity where it allows an

56
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,790
attacker to interfere with a website that processes XML data.

57
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:56,280
Finally, we talk about the idea of insufficient logging and monitoring.

58
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:01,890
You see, to have proper security, you need to have proper logging and monitoring to keep track of

59
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:07,800
all the requests and information that a page might go through, because this can help us determine whether

60
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,990
a certain attack is taking place or not.

61
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,290
If we don't know when an attack is taking place while then we're just not going to notice it.

62
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:18,420
So this is another important topic that we left towards the end of the course.

63
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,000
But then probably why you're taking this course.

64
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,900
And the most exciting part is right here, the bug hunting.

65
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,840
So we're going to talk about how to monetize bug hunting.

66
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:34,740
How can you become an independent researcher that tests Web sites and perhaps collect bug bounty?

67
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,180
Everything that we've learned in this course, we're going to show you how to you can monetize this

68
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:39,660
knowledge.

69
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:46,140
And we're going to talk to you about different platforms that you can use to start a career as a bug

70
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,220
hunter, if that's something that you want to do.

71
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:54,240
Finally, this course is meant for anybody with any sort of programming knowledge.

72
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,720
As a matter of fact, you can take this course without any programming knowledge.

73
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,910
We include bonus material for web.

74
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:06,510
Developer fundamentals, bonus material on Linux and how to use the Linux terminal and even networking.

75
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:09,370
The idea is to take you from zero to mastery.

76
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:16,530
Finally, this course, well, you're in good hands because Alexa is a penetration tester with many

77
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:17,760
years of experience.

78
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:24,090
And he's actually worked on discovering vulnerabilities for multiple companies and government systems.

79
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:29,970
He's going to show you from his professional standpoint how all of this work and how you can actually

80
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:31,790
apply this in real life.

81
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,450
It's going to be a ton of fun.

82
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,190
And the final thing I want to talk about is our community that we have.

83
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:42,210
When he joined this course, as always, as part of the Zurda Mastery community, you get to join our

84
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:47,340
private online discord where we're chatting with people every day, helping each other out, solving

85
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:52,020
problems, doing challenges together and feeling like you're part of a classroom.

86
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:55,500
You're going to find myself in it there every day chatting.

87
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:00,360
And we have a dedicated channel just for this course so that you get to meet other classmates.

88
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,340
All right, that's enough talk.

89
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:03,780
I think it's time to get started.

90
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:07,680
Let's dive into the course and let's learn all about Web security.
